        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <h3>How We Met — And Everything After</h3>
        <p>It’s funny how the most important people in your life sometimes walk in so quietly. Janet and I met during a movie night in university. Nothing dramatic. No spotlight moment.</p>
        <p>We didn’t even talk that night. Just two people in the same room, watching the same film, completely unaware that something meaningful had just begun.</p>
        <p>You came into my life gently, but you stayed intentionally. 💛</p>

        <h2>What You Mean To Me</h2>
        <p>Janet, you have this way of being present. You listen. You understand. You make things lighter without even trying.</p>
        <p>You’re soft but strong. Calm but expressive. Grounded but full of dreams. Being with you has been beautiful, not because everything is perfect, but because it’s real.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="scene-honest" class="scene">
      <div class="story-card grad-cool">
        <h2>The Honest Part</h2>
        <p>I’m still building. Still fixing parts of my life. Still working on my finances. Still becoming the man I know I can be.</p>
        <p>Slow. Intentional. Healthy. Not because I love you any less, but because I love you enough to want to build something solid.</p>

        <h2>If You Ever Doubt Yourself</h2>
        <p>If you ever doubt yourself, I hope you come back to this page. I hope you remember that there is someone who sees you clearly.</p>
        <p>Someone who admires your strength. Someone who notices your softness. Someone who values your mind, not just your beauty. You are not ordinary. And you are not unnoticed.</p>
