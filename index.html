        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>It’s funny how the most important people in your life sometimes walk in so quietly. Janet and I met during a movie night in university. Nothing dramatic. No spotlight moment.</p>
        <p>We didn’t even talk that night. Just two people in the same room, watching the same film, completely unaware that something meaningful had just begun.</p>
        <p>You came into my life gently, but you stayed intentionally. 💛</p>

        <h2>What You Mean To Me</h2>
        <p>Janet, you have this way of being present. You listen. You understand. You make things lighter without even trying.</p>
        <p>You’re soft but strong. Calm but expressive. Grounded but full of dreams. Being with you has been beautiful, not because everything is perfect, but because it’s real.</p>

        <h2>The Honest Part</h2>
        <p>I’m still building. Still fixing parts of my life. Still working on my finances. Still becoming the man I know I can be.</p>
        <p>Slow. Intentional. Healthy. Not because I love you any less, but because I love you enough to want to build something solid.</p>

            <p>Janet, this page is just words and pictures, but what I feel for you goes beyond anything I can design or write. We met in such a simple way, and somehow you’ve become someone deeply important to me.</p>
            <p>In this season where I’m still building, still learning, still fixing parts of my life… you’ve been warmth. You’ve been comfort. You’ve been peace.</p>
            <p>You are my calm. You are my choice. And yes… you are my oversized teddy bear, soft, safe, and somehow strong at the same time.</p>
            <p>I don’t want to rush us. I want to grow into something beautiful. Something intentional. Something that lasts because we built it carefully. And on your birthday, I just want you to know this: you are appreciated, you are valued, and you are loved gently.</p>
            <p class="teddy-sig">Happy Birthday, my oversized teddy bear. 💛</p>
